* *MediatorIfc:*
	** defines an interface for communicating with *Colleague*(AuctionBuyerCls) objects. 

* *AuctionMediatorCls:*
    ** implements cooperative behavior by coordinating Colleague objects.
    ** knows and maintains its colleagues.

* *BuyerCls:*
	** Abstract class for loose coupling. 
	
* *AuctionBuyerCls:*
	** each Colleague class knows its Mediator object.. 
	** each colleague communicates with its mediator whenever it would have
otherwise communicated with another colleague.

    * req_1 : "Auctioner" should communicate each "Bidder"
    * req_3 : "Auctioner" should have *many* "Bidder"s
    * req_3 : "Auctioner" should find highest "Bidder"
    * req_3 : "Auctioner" should *register* its colleagues list for find highest "Bidder"
    * req_2 : "Auctioner" should be able to *add/remove* its "Bidder" 
    

* For loose coupling, above requirements implement as *MediatorIfc* which is interface, therefore *AuctionMediatorCls* is inherited from this interface


    * req_4 : "Bidder" should communicate "Auctioner"
    * req_3 : "Bidder" should have *one* "Auctioner"
    * req_5 : "Bidder" should offer bid.
    * req_5 : "Bidder" should cancel bid.
    

* For loose coupling, above requirements implement as *BuyerCls* which is abstract class, therefore *AuctionBuyerCls* is inherited from this interface
