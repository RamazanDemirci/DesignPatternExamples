
* *SubjectCls:*
	** This class keeps track of all the observers and provides the facility to *add*(*Attach()*) or *remove*(*Detach*) the observers. 
	** Also it is the class that is *responsible for updating the observers*(*Notify()*) when any change occurs.

* *DummyProjectCls:*
	** This class is the real class that *implements the Subject*. 
	** This class is the entity whose change will affect other objects by calling (*Notify()*). 

* *ObserverIfc:*
	** This represents *an interface* that defines the method that should be called whenever there is change.
	** *ObserverIfc::Update()* method is called for notify other objects about changes

* *ShopCls:*
	** This is the class which needs to *keep itself updated* with the change. 
	** This class just needs 
	    *** to *implement* the "ObserverIfc
	    *** *register* itself with the "SubjectCls"
	    *** it is all set to *receive* the "updates".

    * req_1 : "Shop" should know any changes in price of "Product" 
    * req_2 : "Shop" should *observe* any changes in price of "Product"
    * req_3 : "Shop" should *update* when is occured any changes in price of "Product"

* For loose coupling, above requirements implement as *ObserverIfc* which is interface, therefore *ShopCls* is inherited from this interface


    * req_4 : "Product" should have *many* observers
    * req_5 : "Product" should *notify* its observers
    * req_6 : "Product" should *hold* its observers list for notify all observer
    * req_7 : "Product" should be able to *add/remove* its observers

* For loose coupling, above requirements implement as "SubjectCls" which is abstract class, therefore *DummyProductCls* is inherited from this interface
