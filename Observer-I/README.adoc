* *ObservableCls:*
	** This class keeps track of all the observers and provides the facility to *add*(*addObserver()*) or *remove*(*removeObserver*) the observers. 
	** Also it is the class that is *responsible for updating the observers*(*Notify()*) when any change occurs.

* *PatientCls:*
* *PatientRelativeCls:*
	** This class is the real class that *implements the ObservableCls*. 
	** This class is the entity whose change will affect other objects by calling (*Notify()*). 

* *ObserverIfc:*
	** This represents *an interface* that defines the method that should be called whenever there is change.
	** *ObserverIfc::Update()* method is called for notify other objects about changes

* *DoctorCls:*
* *NurseCls:*
	** This is the class which needs to *keep itself updated* with the change in Observable Objects . 
	** This class just needs 
	    *** to *implement* the "ObserverIfc
	    *** *register* itself with the "ObservableIfc"
	    *** it is all set to *receive* the "updates".

    * req_1 : "Doctor" should know any changes in "Patient" status 
    * req_2 : "Doctor" should *observe* any changes in "Patient" status 
    * req_3 : "Doctor" should *update* when is occured any changes of "Patient" status 

* For loose coupling, above requirements implement as *ObserverIfc* which is interface, therefore *ShopCls* is inherited from this interface


    * req_4 : "Patient" should have *many* observers
    * req_5 : "Patient" should *notify* its observers
    * req_6 : "Patient" should *hold* its observers list for notify all observer
    * req_7 : "Patient" should be able to *add/remove* its observers

* For loose coupling, above requirements implement as "SubjectCls" which is abstract class, therefore *DummyProductCls* is inherited from this interface
