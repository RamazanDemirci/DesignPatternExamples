* *PaymentStrategyIfc:*
	** declares an interface common to all supported algorithms. 
	** Context(ShoppingCartCls) uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by Concrete Strategy(CreditCardStrategyCls, PaypalStrategyCls)

* *CreditCardStrategyCls:*
* *PaypalStrategyCls:*
	** implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface(PaymentStrategyIfc).

* *FighterCls:*
	** Abstract class that lets Strategy access its data thus support loose coupling  
	
* *ShoppingCartCls:*
	** is configured with a ConcreteStrategy object.
	** maintains a reference to a Strategy object.

* *ItemCls:*
    ** Action Item Class. Helper Class

	* req_1 : "Shopping Cart" should have many "item"s
	* req_2 : "Shopping Cart" should have *register* "item"s
    * req_3 : "Shopping Cart" should be able to *add/remove* "item"
    * req_4 : "Shopping Cart" should be *pay* by "Payment Strategy" which is inherit PaymentStrategyIfc
    
* For loose coupling, above requirements implement strategy interface ,such as *PaymentStrategyIfc*, therefore *Concrete Strategy* classes are inherited from this interfaces
