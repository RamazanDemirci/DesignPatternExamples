* *ShoppingCartVisitorIfc:*
	** declares a Visit operation for each class of ConcreteElement(BookCls, FruitCls)
	
* *BookCls:*
* *MonitorCls:*
* *MouseCls:*
	** implements each operation declared by Visitor

* *ItemElementIfc:*
    ** defines an Accept operation that takes a visitor interface as an argument.
  
* *ShoppingCartClientCls:*
	** implements an Accept operation that takes a visitor as an argument

	* req_1 : "Shopping Cart" should *execute specific "display" algorithm* for each of its "items"(elements)
		** req_1.1 : "Shopping Cart" should display each item's name and cost
		** req_1.1 : "Shopping Cart" should display each item's name and cost
    * req_2 : "Display algorithm" shall be able to change but "Program" should *not* change "computer parts"
    * req_3 : "Shopping Cart" should calculate total cost.
    
* For loose coupling, above requirements implement visitor interface ,such as *ShoppingCartVisitorIfc*, therefore *Concrete Visitor* classes are inherited from this interfaces
