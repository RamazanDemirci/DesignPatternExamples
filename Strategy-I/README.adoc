* *JumpBehaviorIfc:*
* *KickBehaviorIfc:*
	** declares an interface common to all supported algorithms. 
	** Context(FighterCls) uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by Concrete Strategy(LightningKickCls, ShortJumpCls)

* *LightningKickCls:*
* *TornadoKickCls:*
	** implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface(KickBehaviorIfc).
* *ShortJumpCls:*
* *LongJumpCls:*
	** implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface(JumpBehaviorIfc).

* *FighterCls:*
	** Abstract class that lets Strategy access its data thus support loose coupling  
	
* *ChunLiCls:*
* *KenCls:*
* *RyuCls:*
	** is configured with a ConcreteStrategy object.
	** maintains a reference to a Strategy object.

	* req_1 : "Fighters" should *perform* kick, jump, punch and roll behaviors
    * req_2 : Some "Fighters" should have special kick behaviors such as LightningKick and TornadoKick.
    * req_3 : Some "Fighters" should have special jump behaviors, such as LongJump and ShortJump.
    
* For loose coupling, above requirements implement behavioral interface ,such as *JumpBehaviorIfc, KickBehaviorIfc*, therefore *Concrete Strategy* classes are inherited from this interfaces
