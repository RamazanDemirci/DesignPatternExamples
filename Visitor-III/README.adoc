* *VisitorIfc:*
	** declares a Visit operation for each class of ConcreteElement(BookCls, FruitCls)
	
* *PartsCheckerCls:*
* *PartsOperatorCls:*
	** implements an Accept operation that takes a visitor as an argument

* *VisitableIfc:*
    ** defines an Accept operation that takes a visitor interface as an argument.

* *BikeCls:*
* *EngineCls:*
* *FuelTankCls:*
	** implements each operation declared by Visitor


#######################################

	* req_1 : "Bike" should *execute specific "checker" and "operator" algorithm* for each of its "part"(elements)
		** req_1.1 : "Bike" should *check* each item
		** req_1.1 : "Bike" should *operate* each item's name and cost
    * req_2 : "algorithm"s shall be able to change but "Program" should *not* change "bike parts"
    
* For loose coupling, above requirements implement visitor interface ,such as *VisitorIfc*, therefore *Concrete Visitor* classes are inherited from this interfaces
